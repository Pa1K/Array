1. How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100? 
elements can be repeated or can't, does array holds duplicates - yes
array size tells no.of elements.

case 1:


array - 2,3,5,100
find 1,
linear search 
In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked.

binary search
search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half
sort the array
sort() method is a java.util.Arrays class method. 
Arrays.binarySearch() is the simplest and most efficient method to find an element in a sorted array in Java

Using List.contains() Method: 
List contains() method in Java is used for checking if the specified element exists in the given list or not.
Arrays.asList(arr).contains(toCheckValue);
